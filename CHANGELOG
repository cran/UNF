1.02

- Standardizes representation of non-finite numbers as : +inf, -inf, +nan
- Allows for separate specification of rounding levels for character and numeric
  vectors
- Composite unfs are sorted by unf value which disambiguates ordering
- Discovered that sprintf() internal rounding behavior is inconsistent.
  Now use explicit rounding using IEE 753 "round to nearest".
- UNF Version 4, replaces MD5 with SHA256 algorithm
- check with codetools()
- remove -static (request from Brian Ripley)

1.04 
- Set locale for sort order
- Add vignette
- Move citation
